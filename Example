Plan for gathering feedback:

Gathering feedback:
User	Type of user	Age group	Method of feedback
Class members	Technical	17+	Questionnaire
Parents	Non-technical	35+	Questionnaire
Sister	Non-technical	Primary school (6-7)	Interview/focus group
Cousins	Non-technical	Primary school (3-10)	Interview/focus group
Grandparents	Non-technical	60+	Observation/questionnaire
Aunties/uncles	Non-technical	30-40	Interview/questionnaire
Friends	Both	17-18	Questionnaire

Methods of gathering feedback:
•	Questionnaire – a questionnaire will be made and handed out to be filled in. The answers will be taken from the questionnaire for analysis.
•	Observation – a user will be observed using the prototype. Notes will be taken on what they do and how they do it. Notes may also be taken if the user seems to be struggling on a certain section. Some generic questions may be asked at the end and the users answers will be noted. The notes made will be used for analysis.
•	Interview – a user will be asked questions based on the prototype to see what was good and what could be improved. These answers will be written down and used for analysis.
•	Focus group - a group of users will be sat together to use the prototype and will be asked questions as a group. The answers will be jotted down and used for analysis. This method will be good to use with children so they can work together to use the prototype.

Questions that may could be asked:
•	Did you find the prototype easy to use?
•	Did you understand what you needed to do when using the prototype?
•	Would you recommend this prototype to someone else to use?
•	Are there any changes that you think should be made to the prototype in the future?
•	Do you think that this prototype is something that you would use in your day-to-day life?
•	Is there anything that you were expecting that isn’t included?
•	Did you run into any problems when using the prototype?
•	Was the advice and information given useful?
•	Did you think that the prototype had a good layout? / How could the presentation of the prototype be improved?
•	What feature of the prototype did you like the most?
•	How much would you rate this prototype out of five?
•	Questions could be split into sections for different features and to separate personal questions.
•	Open and closed questions should be asked.
o	An example of an open question is a long-written answer question.
o	An example of a closed question is a multiple-choice question.
•	The questions should provide qualitative and quantitative data. 
o	Qualitative data may include and changes that could be made to improve the prototype.
o	Quantitative data may include scales for rating the prototype. 

Analysis of feedback:
•	How did age affect the feedback given?
•	How did different methods of gathering feedback affect the feedback that was obtained?
•	Were the problems found (if any) consistent?
•	What percentage of users would recommend the prototype to someone else?
•	What percentage of users would use this prototype in their day-to-day life?
•	What percentage of users found the prototypes features useful?
•	What percentage of users like the layout of the prototype and what changes could be made to the layout?
•	What percentage of users found the prototype easy to use?
•	What changes do people think should be made for future iterations?
•	Did people with different health conditions have different feedback to others?
•	Which feature was the overall favourite among users?
•	Provide graphs and statistics as evidence.
